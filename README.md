# PowerGridX (PGX)-demo Repository
Welcome to the demo repository for **PowerGridX (PGX)** – an early stage smart energy startup aiming to solve critical issues( energy theft, poor grid traceability, and access issues) in electricity distribution across Ghana and Africa.

PGX combines **tamper-resistant smart meters**, **renewable-powered smart poles**, **secure top-ups** and **blockchain based authentication** to reduce losses, empower users and modernize underserved grids.

# Repository Overview
This repo contains:
1. **Smart Meter Concept** – Tamper detection + transformer pairing logic
2. **Smart Pole Sketch** – Solar powered IoT pole with LoRa, Wi-Fi, lighting, and sensors
3. **Passive Smart Node** – Low power LoRa relay for legacy pole upgrade
4. **System Architecture** – From transmission to smart metering via LoRa/Satellite
5. **UI / USSD Mockups** – Contractor dashboard, mobile app and USSD recharge logic
6. **Field Insight PDF** – Asset tagging reports + digitalization insights from ECG & BPS
7. **Letters of Intent** – Support from individuals and early potential users


# Why This Matters
Millions across Africa experience unreliable power due to theft, poor grid traceability and lack of infrastructure. PGX is building a secure, IoT enabled platform that blends renewable energy and smart tech to solve these problems, starting from the ground up.
